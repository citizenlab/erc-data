* [OONI Measurement Data](https://ooni.torproject.org/)

[The Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)](https://ooni.torproject.org/) collects data on Internet filtering and network interference from vantage points all around the world by convincing volunteers in various countries to run specialized measurement tools. The tools include [web connectivity tests](https://ooni.torproject.org/nettest/web-connectivity/) that attempt to access lists of potentially censored content, collect the resulting responses, and then analyze them for evidence of censorship. OONI data is [publicly accessible](https://api.ooni.io/).  The ```refurl``` column points to the measurement JSON file that a block was seen in.

* [Manual testing data](July-25-HTTPHeadersLive.txt)

Manual testing data is provided as a text dump of server headers sent by a user in UAE.  These were generated by the [HTTP Live Headers](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/live-http-headers/eaiimeeggnhceafhencnejheejddlcpa?hl=en) plugin.  Present here are the redirects to blockpages seen for tested URLs.
